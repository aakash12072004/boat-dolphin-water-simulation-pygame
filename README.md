# Boat Dolphin Water Simulation (Pygame)

## Project Overview

This project is a Python-based ocean simulation developed using **Pygame and OpenCV**.
It displays a floating boat, moving dolphins, and a horizontally scrolling water background using a video to create a realistic water effect.

---

## Features

* Floating boat with smooth wave motion
* Horizontal boat movement using keyboard controls
* Multiple dolphins moving inside the water
* Collision avoidance between boat and dolphins
* Real-time scrolling water background using video
* Smooth animation and visual effects

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pygame
* OpenCV
* Computer Graphics & Animation Concepts

---

## Controls

| Key          | Action          |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Left Arrow   | Move boat left  |
| Right Arrow  | Move boat right |
| Close Window | Exit program    |

## Project Objectives

* To create a realistic water-based animation using Python.
* To simulate boat floating and dolphin movement.
* To practice video integration and real-time rendering.

---

## Project Outcomes

* Successfully developed an interactive ocean simulation.
* Learned animation, collision handling, and video processing.
* Improved skills in Python, Pygame, and visual simulation design.
